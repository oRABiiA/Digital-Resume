    <p>The task involved creating software for goNature, a company managing multiple nature reserve parks. This software
        aimed to streamline park management by tracking future reservations, including capacity and financial aspects.
        Users could easily make reservations and receive notifications regarding success or failure due to capacity
        constraints. Additionally, the software catered to employees, offering varied functionalities based on their
        roles. These functionalities included scanning visitors' reservations at park entrances and generating revenue
        or capacity reports. Both server-side and client-side components were developed as separate projects to ensure
        efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
