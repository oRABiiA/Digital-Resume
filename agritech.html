    <h1>AgriTech, B.Sc Project (Currently Under Development)</h1>

    <h2>AgriTech is an Avocado tree disease detection system that helps detect various diseases from avocado trees,
        integrates between hardware & software with the goal to reduce Avocado diseases using sensors and camera. The
        disease will be detected using ML models (ShuffleNet V2) and history analysis.</h2>

    </ul>

    <p>This project presents an IoT-based sensor system integrated with machine learning and image processing to enhance
        early disease detection in avocado farming. By collecting real-time environmental data and analyzing images of
        affected plant parts, the system provides accurate and timely insights. Machine learning models classify
        diseases based on patterns in the data, improving precision and reliability. This innovative approach promotes
        sustainable farming, reduces chemical use, increases productivity, and strengthens Israel's position in the
        global avocado market, showcasing the transformative potential of precision agriculture.</p>
